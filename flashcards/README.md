This addon is a [flashcard software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_flashcard_software) that uses [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) as a learning technique.

You can share the flash cards with other users of Hubzilla and ZAP.

Your learning progress will be kept private.

Federation is not tested yet but should be available in the near future. If enabled a user will be able to use the addon without having an account at Hubzulla or ZAP as long as the account supports [ActivityPub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub). Mastodon users have this for example. Stay tuned.
